# EzWarehouse Project

## General information

This is the repository of the university project for 'Software Engineering' course.

The project was made by me and other 3 colleague (team of 4 people) through a waterfall apporach.

### Most important folders

- `code`: front-end and back-end code + tests.
- `deliverables`: all documents needed to be delivered plus a timesheet to keep track of the worktime.

Note: this project was meant to be done and run on gitlab, so if you find strange things or file for CI or gitlab in general ignore those files.
